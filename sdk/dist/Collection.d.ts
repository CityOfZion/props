/**
 * The Collection prop is designed to store static-immutable data for reference in other projects. Storing static data
 * in contracts is very expensive and inefficient, especially for new projects.  This contract resolves that issue by creating
 * library for static data. This class exposes the interface along with a number of helpful features to make the smart
 * contract easy to use for typescript developers.
 *
 * All of the prop helper classes will auto-configure your network settings.  The default configuration will interface with
 * the contract compiled with this project and deployed locally at http://localhost:50012.  For more information on deploying
 * contract packages, refer to the quickstart.
 *
 * All methods support a signer.  If the method can be run as a test-invoke, optionally populating the signer parameter
 * will publish the invocation and return the txid instead of the method response.
 *
 * To use this class:
 * ```typescript
 * import {Collection} from "../../dist" //import {Collection} from "@cityofzion/props
 *
 * const collection: Collection = new Collection()
 * await collection.init() // interfaces with the node to resolve network magic
 *
 * const total = await collection.totalCollections()
 * console.log(total) // outputs the total collection count in the contract
 * ```
