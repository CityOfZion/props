# dice
The dice contract wraps the random number generation features of Neo N3 and exposes some higher level utility.

### Where Am I:
* **PrivateNet:** [Current Location](https://github.com/CityOfZion/props/blob/develop/sdk/src/Dice.ts#L50)
* **Testnet:** [`0x4380f2c1de98bb267d3ea821897ec571a04fe3e0`](https://dora.coz.io/contract/neo3/testnet_rc4/0x4380f2c1de98bb267d3ea821897ec571a04fe3e0)
* **Mainnet:** [`0x4380f2c1de98bb267d3ea821897ec571a04fe3e0`](https://dora.coz.io/contract/neo3/mainnet/0x4380f2c1de98bb267d3ea821897ec571a04fe3e0)

### Including the dice prop in your project:
To use the dice contract, begin by adding the interface to your smart contract.
Below, we provide a complete interface definition in a number of languages to facilitate integration across all major
contract development languages in the Neo N3 ecosystem. You can copy an paste this code directly into your smart contract to
begin using the dice features. Because this is an interface, you only need to include the methods you will use.


 For **SCRIPT_HASH**, refer to the [Where am I?](#where-am-i) section.

#### Direct Import
The dice props is also structured in a way to allow the methods to be built directly into your contract.  To use the
methods as direct import (instead of via contract call), **python** developers can import the `internal` methods found in the
[`contracts/dice/helpers/dice.py`](https://github.com/CityOfZion/props/blob/develop/contracts/dice/helpers/dice.py) library:

```python
from helpers.dice import roll_die_internal, roll_dice_with_entropy_internal, \
     rand_between_internal, map_bytes_onto_range_internal`
```

This approach is not generally recommended, but can be helpful in a few circumstances where using a public contract is a risk.
When directly importing, the examples below are applicable, but the method names have minor differences (`_internal`):
