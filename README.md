# Overview

This repository is a collection of dApps, which main usage is to provide a better user experience on a specific front.

## Props

General purpose smart contracts and developer framework for Neo N3.

## Icon DApp

A smart contract that stores the icons for DApp projects. It allows getting the icons from a common source, removing the need for every project that requires DApp icons to store them internally.

## Price DApp

A smart contract that calculates the price of tokens. It allows getting the price directly from the blockchain, allowing the price data access in smart contracts without the need of a off chain app.
